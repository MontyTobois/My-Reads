## Overview
In this project, I created a bookshelf app that allow the user to find books and categorize them as have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project recommended using React to build the application and provides an API sever and client library.

## Objective
My object was to take the static template and add React.js giving the app interactive features.

## Instructions

### How to run the project

* **Pre-requisite** : Install node.js, npm, and git

* Clone this repo to your terminal or download the zip

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

* Start the development server with `npm start`


## Language

This project is built with **HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (ES6).**

## Important

Please note that the backend server -against which the web app was developped- was provided by Udacity. The provided file BooksAPI.js contains the methods I used to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* getAll
* update
* search

For more information on how these methods are used exactly, please refer to the original Udacity repository.


The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
